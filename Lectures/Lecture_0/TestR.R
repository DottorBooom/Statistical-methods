# Calculate the sum of the first 100 natural numbers.


# Create a vector containing the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 
# Then, multiply each element of the vector by 3.


# Given the vector below, extract all elements greater than 5.
# vec <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)


# Create a data frame with 3 columns: 'Name' (character), 
# 'Age' (numeric), and 'Score' (numeric). The data frame should contain 
# the following data:
# Name: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"
# Age: 25, 30, 22
# Score: 85, 90, 88


# Write a function named `square` that takes a number as input and 
# returns its square.


# Write a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.


# Use the `apply` function to calculate the mean of each row of the matrix
# mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)


# Generate a simple scatter plot using the following vectors:
# x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# y <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)


# Calculate the standard deviation of the following vector:
# data <- c(10, 12, 15, 20, 22)
