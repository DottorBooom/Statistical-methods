# Statistical methods

## Index

+ [Intro to course](#intro-to-course)
+ [Review of some probability concepts](#review-of-some-probability-concepts)

## Introduction

+ It will be entirely in English, slides made by the professor on which I will take notes lesson after lesson.
+ Some books have also been recommended if you want to follow from there or go deeper, I will try to upload those as well.
+ The final exam will be composed by homeworks (10%), 3 intermediate tests (45%) and final project (45%) by a group of 3/4 people.
+ Those students who do not complete all the homework or do not participate to the tests or do not present the final project will have to present a final project and to pass oral exam.
+ This exam will be the first of the two modules that make up the entire course. As soon as I will start it I will put a link in this read.me but you can also find it on my profile.

### What you will learn

+ The course focuses on fundamental elements of statistical infeence, along with some principles and statistical techniques useful for the analysis of complex data
+ A deeper understanding of many tools used in AI and ML and more awareness on properties of methods used.
+ The central theme of the course will be statistical modelling of data, yet the focus will be more on ideas and principles rather than on details of the statistical methodology.
+ Mathematical contents will be limited to a healthy minimum.
+ The learning by doing philosophy will be embodied by the constant usage of the R software throughout the course.

### Common rules & principles

+ Every question is **legitimate and useful**, ask what you do not understand
+ Main pourpose it to **learn**, not to grade
+ Learning is a **process**, not a result
+ Nobody is perfect or always right: **errors and mistake are natural**
+ **Learning is a process in our personal brain**, not in other's one. **Clash with your limits** before check the solution

## Intro to course

A simple introduction with what you have to expect from this course. Everything written above is a summary of the lesson.
An R file that serves as a test of the student's knowledge

Slides and R file are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_0/)

## Review of some probability concepts

### Lecture 1
+ **Random variables**: whate they are, tools used to describe (pmf, pdf, cdf and quantile functions)
+ **Discrete distributions**: probability function, mean, standard deviation, variance and notable discrete random variables
+ **R implementation**: some code that was used during the lecture
Slides and R files are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_1/)

### Lecture 2
+ **Continuos distributions**: densoty function, mean, variance and notable continuos random variables
Slides and R files are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_2/)
  
### Lecture 3
+ **Cumulative distribution function and quantile functions**: what they are, how to use them
+ **R exercise**: Exercises to conclude the chapter and consolidate the use of the tools learned in class
Slides and R file are available [here](Lectures/Lecture_3/)
