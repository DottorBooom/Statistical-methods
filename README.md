## Introduction

+ It will be entirely in English, slides made by the professor on which I will take notes lesson after lesson.
+ Some books have also been recommended if you want to follow from there or go deeper, I will try to upload those as well.
+ The final exam will consist of a project assigned by the professor and a written exam.
+ This exam will be the first of the two modules that make up the entire course, the second is called "High performance computing". As soon as I will start it I will put a link in this read.me but you can also find it on my profile.

### What you will learn

**In this course will be introfuceed the basic concepts of cloud computing** 
+ Cloud
+ XaaS
+ Properties and basic implementations

**Modern cloud architecture and infrastructure**
+ Basic concepts and tutorials
+ Computing and Data Cloud

**Virtual Machines and Containers**
+ Whats is a VM and how to use it, experiments with VBox
+ What is a container and how to use it (Docker)

**Attitude**
+ Don't be (only) a user of pre-cooked tools that you consider as black-boxes

### Common rules & principles

+ Every question is **legitimate and useful**, ask what you do not understand
+ Main pourpose it to **learn**, not to grade
+ Learning is a **process**, not a result
+ Nobody is perfect or always right: **errors and mistake are natural**
+ **Learning is a process in our personal brain**, not in other's one. **Clash with your limits** before check the solution
